# ML-Regression
when we start learning machine learning the first algorithm we learn is regression. I chose regression because it provides a clear idea of what machine learning should be doing, giving machine the strating data training the machine and then using the machine to predict outputs. Besides that Linear-regression models have become a proven way to scientifically and reliably predict the future. Because linear regression is a long-established statistical procedure, the properties of linear-regression models are well understood and can be trained very quickly.
